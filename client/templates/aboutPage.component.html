            This project is a part of the emerging global effort to understand, manipulate and archive historical 
            documents. The goal is to enable it to researchers in paleography, e.g. liturgical texts, archaeology, 
            and history.

               Our previous results include binarization of historical handwritten documents and a preliminary work on writer
            identification and keyword searching in old documents that achieved excellent results. 
            Here we propose to develop new techniques in computer science to manipulate highly degraded documents
             in Hebrew and Arabic; 
            many of our methods will apply to other languages as well.

                The field of historical document analysy has already created many conferences and many journal papers,
                 to disseminate ideas and identify important questions The questions we propose to resolve are applicable
                  to historical documents in any language and from any time period, e.g., binarization of highly degraded
                   documents, segmentation of skewed and curved lines, and word spotting in both curved and highly degraded
                    documents. For several years we have been developing methods to digitally restore degraded historical
                     documents in Hebrew and Arabic, where our group has a unique combination of expertise. 
                     Our scientific expertise in computer vision, image processing, computer graphics and computational
                      geometry has already proven valuable to our colleagues in the humanities in answering questions about
                       Jewish liturgical texts and Arabic historical texts that advance scholarship in these fields.
